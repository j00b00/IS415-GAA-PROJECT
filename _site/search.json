The potentialities of the approach for Liveable City planning and Smart City preparedness, however, have yet to be explored.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning points: The initial stages of data preparation have to be done very meticulously as we want to avoid misrepresentation. For skater analysis, when plotting spatially constrained clusters (Figure 1), it will be better to accompany it with a choropleth map to aid visualization of clusters."

The dissimilarities can be non-euclidean and the weights of the observations can be non uniform.\nLearning points: When trying to carry out Hierarchical clustering, we need to have a dissimilarity matrix D of class dist. It is important for us to alter or transform our matrix to an appropriate data type for the function to work properly. The highlight of the paper is the calculation and algorithms used to do clustering."

    "text": "Title: Cluster Analysis and Segmentation\nSource: https://inseaddataanalytics.github.io/INSEADAnalytics/\nCourseSessions/Sessions45/ClusterAnalysisReading.html#step_8:_robustness_analysis\nSummary: In Data Analytics we often have very large data (many observations - “rows in a flat file”), which are however similar to each other hence we may want to organize them in a few clusters with similar observations within each cluster. For example, in the case of customer data, even though we may have data from millions of customers, these customers may only belong to a few segments: customers are similar within each segment but different across segments. We may often want to analyze each segment separately, as they may behave differently.\nLearning points: Much like any data analysis, segmentation is an iterative process with many variations of data, methods, number of clusters, and profiles generated until a satisfying solution is reached. The paper discusses examples on how to test the statistical robustness and stability of interpretation of clusters found using 2 different approaches."
