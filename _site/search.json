Worship is here considered as the dynamic and varied human response to the theological proposition of Divinity. Specifically, the paper explores the dialectic between the theology of the Reformation and the practice of formal worship, a relation that is given a spatial expression in the Sabbath service."

Using semi-structured interviews, document reviews and agency consultations, this paper focused on three issues: (a) the location and distribution of PoW, (b) factors considered in the location of these PoW by faith groups and (c) planning implications of PoW."

It covers traditional statistical method and algorithms to provide a concept-based problem solving learning approach to mastering practical spatial analytics."

However, it is essential for the current age of society to understand the impact of worship. The analytical understanding is minimal and therefore we aim to provide more understanding over the religious places in both countries."
