# THEME: POINT PATTERN ANALYSIS

# 1 Background

The United States stands as a mosaic of diverse cultures, traditions, and belief systems. Within the country, we can find a multitude of worship places that serve as focal points for spiritual nourishment, community cohesion, and cultural expression. This project will focus on the locations of worship places across the country and unravel the spatial dimensions of religious diversity and explore the profound connections between geography and faith.

# 2 Problem & Motivation

This project holds immense significance in promoting intercultural dialogue, fostering religious tolerance, and contributing to a broader understanding of the United States' multicultural identity. By studying the geographical positions of the worship places, we aim to provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, researchers, and the public, facilitating informed decision-making and enhancing appreciation for the diverse religious mosaic that defines the American experience.

# 3 Project Objectives

• Comprehensive Mapping: Create a comprehensive map detailing the geographic distribution of worship places, categorizing them by religious affiliation. This can be done in a form of drop boxes and slider bars

• Spatial Analysis: Conduct spatial analysis to identify clustering, density, and patterns of religious diversity, shedding light on the coexistence of various faith communities.

• Historical Context: Integrate historical data to understand the evolution of worship places, considering factors such as migration, urbanization, and cultural shifts.

• Accessibility Assessment: Investigate the accessibility of worship places to understand how geographic factors may influence the ability of communities to engage in religious practices.

# 6 Literature Review

## **Title: Towards a spatial theory of worship, Some observations from Presbyterian Scotland**

**Source:** <https://doi-org.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/10.1080/14649360120114143>

**Summary:** The argue that 'worship', a term which has no universal application in religious studies, has been thinly conceived in geographical literature and must be examined both as process and as practice. Worship is here considered as the dynamic and varied human response to the theological proposition of Divinity. Specifically, the paper explores the dialectic between the theology of the Reformation and the practice of formal worship, a relation that is given a spatial expression in the Sabbath service.

## **Title: Religion gnaws urban planning: the geography of places of worship in Kumasi, Ghana**

**Source**: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19463138.2015.1074581>

**Summary**: investigates spatial distribution of places of worship (PoW) and its implications on sustainable land use planning in a rapidly urbanising city of Kumasi, Ghana. Using semi-structured interviews, document reviews and agency consultations, this paper focused on three issues: (a) the location and distribution of PoW, (b) factors considered in the location of these PoW by faith groups and (c) planning implications of PoW.

## **Title: Spatial Analysis with R: Statistics, Visualization, and Computational Methods**

**Summary:** The use and growth of AI, ML and deep learning algorithms with a spatial perspective, and the interdisciplinary use of spatial analysis are all covered in this book. It covers traditional statistical method and algorithms to provide a concept-based problem solving learning approach to mastering practical spatial analytics.

## **Lit-Review Learning points:**

Apart from the articles we have read above, we understand that the concept of geospatial is barely used in conjunction to places of worship. However, it is essential for the current age of society to understand the impact of worship. The analytical understanding is minimal and therefore we aim to provide more understanding over the religious places in both countries.

# 7 Methodology

## 7.1 Data Preparation

-   Data source from online platforms

-   Importing spatial data into the R environment

-   Data wrangling
